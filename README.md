# Dog‚ÄëVision

**Dog‚ÄëVision** is a machine learning project that identifies the breed of a dog from a given image. It harnesses deep learning for image recognition using the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification dataset.

## üöÄ Features

- üê∂ Classifies dog breeds from uploaded images
- üß† Deep learning models trained on real-world data
- üåê Simple Flask web interface for user interaction
- üõ†Ô∏è Utility scripts for preprocessing, training, and automation
- üóÇÔ∏è Organized project structure for clarity and scalability

## üìÇ Dataset

The model uses the [Kaggle Dog Breed Identification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification), which contains thousands of labeled dog images across 120 breeds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nevary-Codes/dog-vision.git
cd dog-vision
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Ensure your trained model file(s) are placed in the `models/` directory and sample images in `uploads/`.

### Running the Web App

```bash
python app.py
```

Then visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.
